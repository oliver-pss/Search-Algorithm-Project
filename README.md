# Search-Algorithm-Project
A simple maze game with an auto-solve feature using Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, and A* Search.

This is a simple project meant to demonstrate my basic understanding of different search algorithms.

To start, choose a difficulty level.
Then, using your arrow keys, choose a direction to travel.
The goal is to reach the garage in the shortest amount of moves possible.

Alternatively, you can choose a search algorithm to implement, between Breath-First-Search, Depth-First-Search, or A*-Search with a heuristic.

The maze is a template that I followed from a youtuber named Devression:

The algorithms were implemented by myself, using knowledge from a class at university.
